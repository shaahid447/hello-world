# hello-world

Fellow Innovators! My Comrades

I have yet to discover what I am doing in this venture, why i began it and if what I am presently doing will establish some clarity in the direction of my growth.
I have challenged myself as a writer to measure my ability to write code as well as i do the artistic poetry that is my life.

We are no one in this quest,
Take me as your own and nurture me and you will have found a worthy companion yet.

All hope is not lost, I am here to accompany you down the path to salvation.

Peace out.

Mohammed Shaahid
